    <h2>Finding a Home</h2>

    <p>Sleeves the kobold had wandered through valleys, forests, and hills, looking for a place to call his own. Every burrow seemed too dark, every cave too damp, and every little hut too crowded. He tried three different homes, but each one had its problems—mudslides, noisy neighbors, or too many spiders.</p>
    <p>One crisp morning, Sleeves climbed a small hill and saw a hidden grove filled with sunlight and soft moss. The trees formed a natural roof, and the little stream nearby sparkled like silver. It felt warm, safe, and perfect.</p>
    <p>With a happy squeak, Sleeves unpacked his tiny knapsack and settled down. At last, he had found a place to rest his head and dream of new adventures. The grove was his, and he promised to care for it every day.</p>

    <h2>Saving the Town with Kindness</h2>

    <p>One day, Sleeves wandered into a small village in trouble. The townsfolk were worried—their crops were wilting, and the watermill had stopped turning. While other heroes might have rushed in with swords or magic, Sleeves decided to try something different: kindness.</p>
    <p>He helped carry baskets, cleaned the river, and shared jokes that made the villagers laugh. Every act of help seemed small, but slowly the town came back to life. The crops perked up, the mill spun again, and the villagers’ smiles returned.</p>
    <p>By evening, the villagers gathered around Sleeves, cheering. “Your kindness saved us,” they said. Sleeves only smiled and wiggled his tail. Sometimes, he thought, a gentle heart was the strongest magic of all.</p>

    <h2>The Little Library</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png?text=Sleeves+Library" alt="Sleeves the Kobold with Library" class="story-image">
    <p>Sleeves had always loved stories, and one day he dreamed of having his very own library. He found a quiet nook in his grove, collected old scrolls, colorful books, and even a few enchanted maps, and stacked them carefully on tiny shelves.</p>
    <p>Every morning, he would curl up in a soft mossy chair and read aloud to the birds, the squirrels, and even the shy rabbits. Sometimes he would write his own tiny adventures on scraps of parchment and tuck them between the pages.</p>
    <p>Soon, animals from nearby forests came to listen to his stories, and travelers paused to read. Sleeves’ little library became a place of magic, learning, and friendship—a perfect ending for a wandering kobold who loved adventures and stories more than anything.</p>
