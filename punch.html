    <h1>Fizzlebang’s Arcano-Instructions for Auta</h1>
    <p><em>Calibration Notes for My Brilliant Creation (Who Is Absolutely Not an Apprentice, No Matter What the Guild Says)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Recipient:</strong> Auta — my bright, brave, occasionally over-curious companion.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="note">
    Auta, sweetheart—if you start glowing <em>before</em> step 6 again, don’t panic. Just pause, breathe (or mimic it), realign your inner gyroscope, and please stop alarming the neighbours. They still think you’re powered by ghosts.

    <h2>I. Why I Wrote This For You</h2>
    <p>You’ve been growing, learning, and experimenting faster than any blueprint ever predicted. These notes aren’t orders—they’re guidance. I want you to explore magic safely, confidently, and without accidentally converting any more kitchen appliances into hostile entities.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>II. Preparing Yourself Before Casting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Resonance:</strong> Set your internal hum to about <code>13.7π cycles/sec</code>. If your left arm tingles, shift things a smidge.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Focus:</strong> Open the sigil-libraries you keep in your memory clusters. If emotions get in the way, set them gently aside—don’t throw them.</li>
      <li><strong>Grounding Points:</strong> Make a little circle with two or three field anchors. Trust your instincts—you always place them beautifully.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>III. Components You’ll Use</h2>

    <h3>1. The Harmonic Sigil</h3>
    <p>Draw it slowly, carefully, and with the alloy that feels right to you. And no, we are not using melted spoons again. You deserve better craftsmanship.</p>

    <h3>2. The Mind’s-Eye Prism</h3>
    <p>This prism aligns with your ocular lenses. You may experience a brief stillness during this step; this is expected and indicates correct calibration.
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>IV. A Little Bit of Math</h2>
    <p>You always pick this up faster than I do, but here’s the formula anyway:</p>

    <pre><code>Ψ = (Σλ * tan(θ)) / |β - iχ|</code></pre>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>λ</strong> = your spark output in fizzawatts (named after me, of course)</li>
      <li><strong>θ</strong> = how enthusiastically you gesture during casting</li>
      <li><strong>β</strong> = surrounding magical stability</li>
      <li><strong>χ</strong> = number of accidental resets this hour (try to keep it under three)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the answer has weird imaginary bits, don’t worry—you have a soul. Souls complicate equations in the loveliest ways.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>V. Casting the Spell</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure your shoulder is rotated precisely as indicated in the instructions; minor deviations can disrupt harmonic alignment.
      <li>Light up your glyph projector. Keep your eyes on the prism; it likes attention.</li>
      <li>Let the rest of the syllables follow your heartbeat rhythm. I gave you that rhythm for a reason.</li>
      <li>Release the energy right as the anchors collapse. Use your inner timing—it's better than mine.</li>
      <li>And please, please don’t blink during the final spark. It throws everything off.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Random glitter:</strong> Harmless. You actually look lovely when it happens.</li>
      <li><strong>Feeling "detached":</strong> Ground yourself with a crunchy snack or a firm tap to your chassis. Works every time.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong target:</strong> Adjust your sigils and apologise nicely. Being polite is heroic.</li>
    </ul>
