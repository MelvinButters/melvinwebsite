    <h1>For Auta</h1>

    <p>
      If you are reading this, then the moment has already passed — or is closer than either of us would like to admit.
      I have never been good at saying the important things aloud, so I leave them here instead, where the words cannot
      tremble or be interrupted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world will always demand pieces of you. Time, courage, certainty. Sometimes it will ask for more than is fair.
      When that happens, remember this: the things you hold dear are not weaknesses. They are the reason you endure at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Protect them. Protect the people, the ideals, the quiet hopes you carry when no one is watching. Not because the
      world deserves them — but because <em>you</em> do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Say what must be said while breath and chance still allow it. Regret is a heavier burden than fear, and silence
      has ended more stories than any blade ever has.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      Whatever comes next, know that I believed in you — not because you were flawless, but because you chose to care
      in a world that makes that choice difficult.
    </p>
