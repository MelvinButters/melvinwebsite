  <div class="entry">
The wells ran black with the fever I set loose. I remember the cries of the villages, the coughing and the clinging to life, and I remember thinking it was for the greater good. The infection spread, and with it, my hands stained deeper than I had ever imagined.
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
Keket. Every time I see her, I see the parents I ended. I cannot undo it. Each smile she gives feels like a knife twisting in my gut, a reminder that I caused her loss. And yet… I watch over her, protect her. The greater good demanded it, but at what cost to my soul?
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
Sometimes I pray for absolution, but the gods seem distant. Perhaps they understand, or perhaps they have turned away in disappointment. Every day I try to reconcile the man I was—the instrument of death—with the man I must be, guarding the life I once destroyed.
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
Tonight, the candle flickers as if mocking me. I write these words so that one day, should anyone read them, they might understand that righteousness is not simple. The plague, the suffering—it was meant to save, yet all I feel is the weight of what I took.
  <div class="final-line">
Forgive me, Keket. Forgive me, world.
  </div>
