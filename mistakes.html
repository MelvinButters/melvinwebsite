Do I give you everything you ever want
Pick you up when you cannot
Save you from your painful thoughts
Give you something worth waking for


I'm sorry I 
Always have to lose my patience
Scream at your mistakes when
I know that you hate it

I promise I
Always love you all the same and
Miss you every day when
Ever you're away and


I love when we are a little family
You me and the stunky
I know sometimes I act your enemy
But we're getting there eventually

    
I'm so insanely proud of you for trying so hard all the time
I know that we have dark days but I always know that we'll be fine
I miss the days when we would stay up late and talk into the night
That's how I know that everything we ever do will turn out right

    
I'm sorry I 
Always have to lose my patience
Scream at your mistakes when
I know that you hate it

I promise I
Always love you all the same and
Miss you every day when
Ever you're away and



I'm sorry I 
Always have to lose my patience
Scream at your mistakes when
I know that you hate it

I promise I
Am trying to erase it
Trying to embrace
Put a smile on your face
