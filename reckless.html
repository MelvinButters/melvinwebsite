    Auta, this technique assumes you have already accepted that pain is temporary,
    but glory is forever (or at least remembered loudly).

    <h2>I. Philosophy of Recklessness</h2>
    <p>
      To attack recklessly is not to attack foolishly — though the distinction is subtle
      and often ignored. Recklessness is the conscious decision to abandon caution
      in favor of overwhelming intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not defending yourself because you are declaring, quite clearly,
      that the enemy will not survive long enough for their counterattack to matter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>II. Mental Preparation (Very Important, Actually)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Empty your mind of doubt, fear, and tactical restraint.</li>
      <li>Focus exclusively on the target and the satisfaction of impact.</li>
      <li>Accept, calmly, that you <em>will</em> be hit in return.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hesitation negates the entire technique. If you are thinking about defense,
      you are doing it wrong.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>III. Execution Guidelines</h2>

    <h3>1. Commit Fully</h3>
    <p>
      When you strike, do not pull back, feint, or guard. Open your stance.
      Overextend. Let momentum carry the blow through the target and into whatever
      unfortunate object exists behind them.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Ignore the Opening</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, you are exposed. Yes, they can hit you more easily now.
      This is acceptable. You are trading safety for certainty.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Press the Advantage</h3>
    <p>
      Once the first reckless strike lands, continue the assault without pause.
      Momentum is your shield now. Doubt is the enemy.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>IV. Common Mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stopping to reassess:</strong> Absolutely defeats the point.</li>
      <li><strong>Trying to dodge afterward:</strong> Too late. Commit.</li>
      <li><strong>Apologizing mid-swing:</strong> Unacceptable.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>V. When NOT to Attack Recklessly</h2>
    <p>
      Rare, but worth noting:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When protecting someone who cannot survive retaliation.</li>
      <li>When retreat is the actual objective (I know, unpleasant).</li>
      <li>When the enemy is clearly baiting you and smiling far too much.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <div class="note">
    Final reminder: Reckless assault is not about anger alone.
    It is about trust — trust in your strength, your endurance,
    and your allies to finish what you begin.
